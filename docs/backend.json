    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure is designed to reflect the core features of the 'Desafío HV' app, focusing on user profiles, study sessions, exercises, a virtual store, a subscription service (PaseHV), casino games, and a ranking system. The structure emphasizes authorization independence and supports the required QAPs by using path-based ownership for user-specific data and structural segregation for different data access needs.\n\n*   **/users/{userId}/userProfile:** Stores user profile data. This uses path-based ownership. It enables simple security rules where only the authenticated user can access their own profile. This also supports QAPs by ensuring that list operations are always scoped to a single user. The `userId` is derived from `request.auth.uid`.\n*   **/users/{userId}/studySessions/{studySessionId}**: Stores study session data. This uses path-based ownership. Only the user can create, read, update, and delete their own study sessions. This structure supports QAPs by ensuring list operations are scoped to a single user.  The `userId` is derived from `request.auth.uid`.\n*   **/exercises/{exerciseId}**: Stores exercise data available to all users. This collection is separate from user-specific data, enabling different security rules. This supports QAPs because listing exercises doesn't require filtering based on user-specific permissions. The `exercises` collection can be made publicly readable.\n*   **/users/{userId}/userExercises/{userExerciseId}**: Stores user-specific exercise data, indicating which exercises a user has completed. This uses path-based ownership and ensures that only the user can access their own exercise records. This structure supports QAPs by ensuring that list operations are scoped to a single user. The `userId` is derived from `request.auth.uid`.\n*   **/products/{productId}**: Stores product data for the virtual store. This collection is separate from user-specific data. It can be made publicly readable.\n*   **/users/{userId}/purchases/{purchaseId}**: Stores purchase history for each user, linking to products. This uses path-based ownership. This structure supports QAPs because listing purchases is scoped to a single user. The `userId` is derived from `request.auth.uid`.\n*   **/paseHV/{paseHVId}**: Stores the different PaseHV subscription tiers. This collection can be made publicly readable. This structure supports QAPs because listing PaseHV subscriptions doesn't require user-specific permissions.\n*   **/casinoGames/{casinoGameId}**: Stores information about the casino games. This collection is separate from user-specific data, enabling different security rules. This supports QAPs because listing casino games doesn't require filtering based on user-specific permissions. The `casinoGames` collection can be made publicly readable.\n*   **/users/{userId}/gamePlays/{gamePlayId}**: Stores the gameplay history for each user. This uses path-based ownership, ensuring only the user can access their own gameplay records. This structure supports QAPs because listing gamePlays is scoped to a single user. The `userId` is derived from `request.auth.uid`.\n*   **/rankings/{rankingId}**: Stores the ranking of users based on their total points.  Each document in the `rankings` collection represents the ranking for a single user (1:1 relationship). It can be made publicly readable."
